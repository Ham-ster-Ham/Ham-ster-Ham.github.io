Welcome to the GitHub for my website!

Currently, I am overhauling a website I made on Neocities; and I thought I'd port it to GitHub for fun!

If the website looks funny, it is probably your dark mode extension. This issue happened to me and disabling it for this site fixed it :)

Current plans:
start a log or a journal of sorts, put it somewhere in extras
expand the Wizard's chamber, spice it up a little, maybe make it the whole extras section
add more games to the steam launcher, stylize it maybe
make code more modular
add blahaj
update Neocities site to redirect to current GitHub repo
delete or private the first repo
add more things im interested in to maybe a showcase room of sorts
